Shortest remaining time first scheduling is a pre-emptive version of shortest job scheduling. In SRTF, job with the shortest CPU burst will be scheduled first. Because of this process, It may cause starvation as shorter processes may keep coming and a long CPU burst process never gets CPU.Pre-emptive just means a process before completing its execution is stopped and other process can start execution. The stopped process can later come back and continue from where it was stopped. In pre-emptive scheduling, suppose process P1 is executing in CPU and after some time process P2 with high priority then P1 will arrive in ready queue then p1 is pre-empted and p2 will brought into CPU for execution. In this way if process which is arriving in ready queue is of higher priority then p1, then p1 is always pre-empted and it may possible that it suffer from starvation.Round robin will give better response time then FCFS ,in FCFS when process is executing ,it executed up to its complete burst time, but in round robin it will execute up to time quantum. So Round Robin Scheduling improves response time as all processes get CPU after a specified time.
If time quantum is very large, then scheduling happens according to FCFS.
Shortest job next may lead to process starvation for processes which will require a long time to complete if short processes are continually added.
