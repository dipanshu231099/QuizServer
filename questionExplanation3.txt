The size of page table may become too big to fit in contiguous space. That is why page tables are typically divided in levels.
There are two important tasks in virtual memory management: a page-replacement strategy and a frame-allocation strategy. Frame allocation strategy says gives the idea of minimum number of frames which should be allocated. The absolute minimum number of frames that a process must be allocated is dependent on system architecture, and corresponds to the number of pages that could be touched by a single (machine) instruction.
Size of a page = 4KB = 2^12.Total number of bits needed to address a page frame = 32 – 12 = 20.If there are ‘n’ cache lines in a set, the cache placement is called n-way set associative. Since TLB is 4 way set associative and can hold total 128 (2^7) page table entries, number of sets in cache = 2^7/4 = 2^5. So 5 bits are needed to address a set, and 15 (20 – 5) bits are needed for tag.
