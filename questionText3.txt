A multilevel page table is preferred in comparison to a single level page table for translating virtual address to physical address because A) It reduces the memory access time to read or write a memory location. B) It helps to reduce the size of page table needed to implement the virtual address space of a process. C) It is required by the translation lookaside buffer. D) It helps to reduce the number of page faults in page replacement algorithms.
The minimum number of page frames that must be allocated to a running process in a virtual memory environment is determined by A)the instruction set architecture B)page size C)physical memory size D)number of processes in memory.
A CPU generates 32-bit virtual addresses. The page size is 4 KB. The processor has a translation look-aside buffer (TLB) which can hold a total of 128 page table entries and is 4-way set associative. The minimum size of the TLB tag is: A)11 bits B)13 bits C)15 bits D)20 bits.
